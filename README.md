# Mail Bites Hugo Mock Landing Page 


Thia is a landing page generated for Team 14's final project for CIS 3500. It was built using the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Hugo Bootstrap Theme](https://github.com/filipecarneiro/hugo-bootstrap-theme). The project is a chrome extension called Mail Bites that scrapes the user's Gmail safely and provides unread email summaries, priority rankings, a to-do list, and generated replies.
